Code Ninja is a versatile tool that serves as a code converter, code quality checker, and code debugger. It empowers developers to streamline their coding workflow and enhance code quality effortlessly.

**Note:**

Might be the functionality will not work properly, as I have used the OPENAI free one-month API, which will expire after one month. So the website may not work correctly. However, you can watch a video demonstration of the Code Ninja functionality [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ITYQAepLg3K67DvCKHZjBQnALdVf7fwe?usp=drive_link).

## Features

- **Code Conversion:** Convert code between various programming languages effortlessly.
- **Code Quality Checker:** Ensure your code adheres to best practices and coding standards.
- **Code Debugger:** Debug your code efficiently to identify and fix issues.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive user interface makes coding tasks a breeze.

## Usage
